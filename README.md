# PainlessMesh Smart home network
This is my implementation of Painless Mesh to create a better alternative for smart home solutions using Mesh networking technologies

The implementation automatically picks a single node that will act as a network bridge, this network bridge will allow cross network communciation, this allows the nodes to have their own isolated network that can still communicate with the users network. The bridge will also host a website that will interact with other nodes on the network.
